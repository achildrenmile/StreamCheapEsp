# StreamCheapEsp
Based on the idea of Dave Madison on building a reliable stream deck on low budget (<20 Euro), this is the ESP32 version of this idea.
The original stream deck code as well as the casing information can be found here: https://www.partsnotincluded.com/diy-stream-deck-mini-macro-keyboard/.

# Where can I find the casing to print it with a 3d printer?
Based on this design https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2822140, the base was changed to fit the ESP32 in the form factor WEMOS Mini. Tested this out with an ESP32 MH-ET Live.
You can find the stl of the base here: https://github.com/achildrenmile/StreamCheapEsp/blob/main/StreamCheap_Base_ESP32.stl.

# Do I really need to buy the relagendable key caps?
No, you can download them on thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3791028. Thanks to https://www.thingiverse.com/Mc_gee!

# How to flash the software?
Download the ino file and open it with e.g. Arduino IDE. Choose one ESP32 board. Flash it and connect the keyboard. You are done!

# How to assign the hotkeys in e.g. OBS?
